# Card Payment Details in PDF Download Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the appointment confirmation PDF download feature to include detailed payment information specifically for **card payments only**. When users pay for appointments using Stripe (card payment), the downloaded PDF now includes comprehensive payment details.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AppointmentController.java** 
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/example/health_care_system/controller/AppointmentController.java`

**Modified Method**: `downloadAppointmentConfirmation()`

**Changes**:
- Added code to retrieve payment details from the database using `PaymentService`
- Passes the payment object to the PDF generation service
- Payment is retrieved as `Optional<Payment>` and passed as null if not found

```java
// Get payment details if exists (for card payment details in PDF)
Payment payment = paymentService.getPaymentByAppointmentId(appointmentId).orElse(null);

// Generate PDF with payment details
byte[] pdfBytes = pdfGenerationService.generateAppointmentConfirmationPdf(
    appointment, patient, doctor, hospital, payment);
```

### 2. **PdfGenerationService.java**
**Location**: `src/main/java/com/example/health_care_system/service/PdfGenerationService.java`

**Modified Method**: `generateAppointmentConfirmationPdf()`

**Changes**:
1. **Added Payment import**:
   ```java
   import com.example.health_care_system.model.Payment;
   ```

2. **Updated method signature** to accept Payment parameter:
   ```java
   public byte[] generateAppointmentConfirmationPdf(
       Appointment appointment,
       Patient patient,
       Doctor doctor,
       Hospital hospital,
       Payment payment)  // New parameter
   ```

3. **Enhanced Payment Information Section**:
   - Added conditional check to display detailed payment information **ONLY for CARD payments**
   - Other payment methods (CASH, INSURANCE, FREE) remain unchanged
   - Displays the following for card payments:
     * **Payment Method**: Shows "Card Payment (Stripe)"
     * **Payment Amount**: Shows the actual amount paid (Rs. XXX)
     * **Payment Status**: Shows status with green highlight if COMPLETED
     * **Payment Success Confirmation Message**: Shows "✓ Payment Successfully Completed - Your appointment has been confirmed and paid." in green for completed payments
     * **Transaction ID**: Shows Stripe transaction ID (if available)

## PDF Payment Details Section (Card Payments Only)

### For Card Payments (COMPLETED status):
```

                        and paid. (in green, bold)

2. Selects **Card** as payment method

## Technical Implementation

### Payment Detection Logic
```java
// Only add payment details if:
// 1. Payment object exists (not null)
// 2. Payment method is CARD
if (payment != null && payment.getPaymentMethod() == Payment.PaymentMethod.CARD) {
    // Show detailed payment information
}
```

### Payment Status Styling
- **COMPLETED status**: Displayed in green with checkmark (✓)
- **Other statuses**: Displayed normally without special styling
- **Confirmation message**: Only shown for COMPLETED status in bold green text

## Benefits
