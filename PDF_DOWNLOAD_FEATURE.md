## How It Works

### For Users:
1. User books an appointment (Government or Private hospital)
2. After successful booking, user is redirected to success page
3. On success page, user sees a red "Download Appointment Details" button
4. Clicking the button downloads a PDF file with all appointment information
5. PDF can be saved and printed for reference

### Technical Flow:
1. User clicks download button
2. Browser sends GET request to `/appointments/download-confirmation/{appointmentId}`
3. Controller validates:
   - User is logged in
   - Appointment exists
   - Appointment belongs to the user
4. Controller fetches:
   - Appointment details
   - Patient details
   - Doctor details
   - Hospital details
5. PdfGenerationService creates PDF with all information
6. Controller returns PDF as byte array with proper headers
7. Browser downloads the PDF file
